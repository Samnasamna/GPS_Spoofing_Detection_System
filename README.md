# GPS Spoofing Detection System for Smart Agriculture

This project implements a GPS spoofing detection system for autonomous farm equipment. It uses machine learning models in a federated learning setup to detect spoofing activity and visualize alerts in real time through a lightweight UI. The system is optimized for low-power edge devices in smart agriculture environments.
